\section*{Problem 1 (15 pts)}
GE has three operating divisions: GE capital (50\%), GE
  Technology Infrastructure (25\%) and GE Energy (25\%). The CFO wants
  to estimate the cost of capital for each division, to help in
  capital budgeting. GE is financed 40\% by debt, with $\beta_D=.2$. The current
  interest rate is 6\% and the expected market return is 14\%. 
The following three competitors have investments similar to
  those of GE's three divisions (with debt practically risk-free): 
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
Company & Equity Beta & $D/(D+E)$\\
A & .9 & .1 \\
B & 1.5 & .3 \\
C & 1.4 & .6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the cost of capital for each division? (6 pts)
\item What is GE's equity beta? (9 pts)
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Problem 2 (10 pts)}
Consider four different stocks, all of which have a required return of 16 percent and a most recent dividend of \$2.90 per share. Stocks A, B and C are expected to maintain constant growth rates in dividends for the foreseeable future of 10 percent, 0 percent and -5 percent per year. Stock D is a growth stock that will increase its dividend by 20 percent for the next two years and maintain a constant 12 percent growth rate, thereafter. Discuss the relationship among the various returns that you find for each of these stocks. 

\section*{Problem 3 (15 pts)}
Your friend is celebrating her 35th birthday today and wants to start saving for her anticipated
retirement at age 65 (she will retire on her 65th birthday). She would like to be able to
withdraw \$80,000 from her savings account on each birthday for at least 20 years following
her retirement (the first withdrawal will be on her 66th birthday). Your friend intends to
invest her money in the local savings bank which offers 4 percent per year. She wants to
make equal annual deposits on each birthday in a new savings account she will establish for
her retirement fund.
If she starts making these deposits on her 36th birthday and continues to make deposits
until she is 65 (the last deposit will be on her 65th birthday), what amount must she deposit
annually to be able to make the desired withdrawals upon retirement?

\section*{Problem 4 (15 pts)}
You have developed the technology to use gold to produce high capacity fiber optic switches.
The technology has cost \$5 million to develop. You need \$50 million of initial capital
investment to start production. Sales of the switch sales will be \$20 million per year for
the next 5 years and then drop to zero. The main cost of production is gold. Each year,
you need 20,000 ounces of gold. Gold is currently selling for \$250 per ounce. Your supplier
thinks that the gold price will appreciated at 5\% per year for the next 5 years. The cost of
capital is 10\% for the fiber-optics business. The tax rate is 35\%. The capital investment can
be depreciated linearly over the next 5 years.
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate the after-tax cash flow of the project
\item Should you take the project?

\section*{Problem 5 (15 pts)}
 Emile's company has existing assets that generates an EPS of \$4. If
 Emile does not invest except to maintain existing assets, EPS is expected
 to remain constant at \$4 a year. However, starting next year (end of
 this year), Emile has the chance to invest \$2.5 per share a year in
 developing a newly technology. Each investment is expected to
 generate a permanent 18\% return. Note: Assume that this return is
 not compounded. So each year
Emile gets 2.5 $\times$ .18. However, the technology will be fully developed by the end of the fifth year.

What will be the stock price and PE ratio assuming that investors require a 12\% rate of return?
